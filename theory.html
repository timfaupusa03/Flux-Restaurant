                    Flux is more than a restaurant — it's an edible conversation.
                    Every course is inspired by <b>Relational Dialectics Theory (RDT)</b>, 
                    a way of understanding relationships that sees them as dynamic, 
                    ever-shifting, and full of tensions that can't be permanently “solved” 
                    — only navigated. 
                    Rather than treating tension as conflict, RDT invites us to see it as 
                    the heartbeat of connection.
                    In every relationship, there are <b>opposing</b> needs — closeness and space, 
                    openness and privacy, predictability and surprise. Flux serves these 
                    tensions to you, one course at a time, so you can taste them, talk about 
                    them, and perhaps see them in a new light.

                        <h3>WHAT IS RELATIONAL DIALECTS THEORY?</h3>

                        <p>Relational Dialectics Theory (RDT) was developed by communication scholars 
                            Leslie Baxter and Barbara Montgomery in the 1980s. It proposes that 
                            relationships aren't static — they're ongoing conversations between 
                            contradictory but equally important desires. These contradictions are called 
                            dialectical tensions.

                        <h3>KEY IDEAS OF RDT:</h3>
                        <p>
                            1. Tensions are natural — They're not signs of something “wrong,” but a sign 
                            that both needs matter.<br>
                            2. No permanent solutions — You don't “fix” tensions; you manage them over time.<br>
                            3. Tensions exist in dialogue — We make sense of relationships through the 
                            conversations we have.<br>
                            4. They're everywhere — RDT applies to romantic relationships, friendships, 
                            families, and even work partnerships.<br>

                        Most of us are taught to “resolve” disagreements or “balance” needs as if there's a 
                        perfect midpoint. RDT teaches that healthy relationships can live in the stretch — 
                        where two opposing truths exist side-by-side.<br>Flux brings this concept off the page 
                        and onto your plate, giving you a shared experience you can literally chew on.

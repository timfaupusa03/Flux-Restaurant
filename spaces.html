                    At Flux, every dining space is thoughtfully designed to immerse you 
                    in the rhythms of relationship — the balances and contradictions that 
                    shape how we connect, separate, reveal, and retreat. Each room offers a 
                    unique setting for your shared journey through relational dialectics.

                        <h3>THE CONFLUENCE HALL</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Confluence Hall embodies the tension of Autonomy ↔ Connection — a space where 
                            individuality and togetherness flow side by side.<br>Warm wood tones blend with sleek 
                            steel accents. Tables are arranged asymmetrically to foster intimate pockets of space, 
                            while light cascades through layered glass panels that reflect and distort, echoing the fluid 
                            dance of closeness and independence.<br>Here, pairs and small groups can engage deeply 
                            while savoring their own rhythms — part of the community, yet distinct within it.

                        <p>
                            Step into the Horizon Garden, where Stability ↔ Change comes alive. Rooted in nature's steady 
                            rhythms yet shifting with light, season, and weather, this space mirrors the comfort of the 
                            familiar and the thrill of growth. Modular seating lets you dine alone, share a table for 15, 
                            or anywhere in between — your arrangement reflects the balance between constancy and transformation. 
                            Maple wood tables, vibrant greenery, bright canopy drapes and seasonal blooms make the Horizon Garden 
                            a living metaphor for relationships in motion.

                        <h3>THE EMBER ALCOVE</h3>
                        <p>
                            The Ember Alcove embodies the tension of Openness ↔ Closedness — the delicate balance between sharing 
                            and protecting. The sweeping curves and layered textures form a warm, protective shell, offering seclusion 
                            and intimacy. Yet, the subtle openness of the space, with glimpses into the surrounding restaurant, keeps 
                            guests connected to the wider rhythm of the evening. An exclusive feature of The Ember Alcove is its Chef's 
                            Passage — a private corridor leading guests behind the scenes for a curated kitchen tour. In this moment, 
                            the walls of privacy fall away as the chef reveals the inspirations, ingredients, and stories behind the 
                            evening's menu, before diners retreat once more into the intimate glow of their alcove.
